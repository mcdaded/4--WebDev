This chapter centers on creating a static site generator.
=========================================================

This is something I have a good interest in as I think it could be useful for
building a site then hosting it on S3.

Can build with the:
`python prototypes.py build`

Can serve the static site by navigating to the _build directory and running:
`python -m http.server 9000`


Compressor needs `pip install django-compressor`
