This is based on the tic tac toe tutorial on reactjs.org

To start a new react app with boilerplate code you can do the following
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app myapp
cd myapp
npm start

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
following this demo, remove the files from /src and add in the source index.js and index.css code
