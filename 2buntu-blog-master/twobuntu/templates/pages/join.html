        We are a group of bloggers committed to excellence and we want to make sure that everything we
        publish reflects this excellence in every way possible.
        Therefore we have put together this guide to help new bloggers get an idea of what type of
        articles we are looking for and how they can join our team.
    </p>
    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        Before explaining how 2buntu works, we feel it is important that we describe the type of
        content that we want and do <em>not</em> want published on 2buntu. Please read through this list
        carefully.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <span class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></span>
                All content must relate to the Ubuntu operating system in some way.
                Content that relates to other Linux distributions is allowed so long
                as the content applies to Ubuntu as well.
            </div>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <span class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></span>
                Articles must not be too short. Our rule of thumb: the article should consist of
                at least 60+ lines when rendered in the browser. We value quality over quantity.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <span class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></span>
                Articles must be free from profanity, obscenity, and personal threats.
                In general, we discourage articles with an overly negative tone (rants, for example).
                Articles must also refrain from embedding copyrighted content.
            </div>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <span class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></span>
                We reserve the right to edit any articles as we see fit in order to comply with these guidelines.
